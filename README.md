# ðŸ“ˆ About me
My name is William Gailey I come from a small living farm in Oregon, in HS i was AFJROTC (Drill team and Color Guard) along with the ski team. Throughout K-12 I foremost studied technology and physics while running and doing pushups.

I'm a recognized expert in networking who can code in over a dozen languages both interpreted and compiled. I hold two degrees which are primarily Cisco, Linux, software development and physics. I've worked in technology and business for over a decade including management roles. These days I spend my spare time in the gym or near a waterfall.
  
I first learned to code in 1998 in a engineering class using assembly on robotics. I then moved onto classes in business applications and web development where I learned what is now xhtml, css, javascript, photoshop, and flash animations. I freelanced and wrote macros in VBA and built websites. In college I wrote both JAVA and python applications to run robotics hardware as well as bash, c, and javascripts which you can check out some of in my examples repository.
