ðŸ‘‹ Hello my name is William Gailey and I'm a recognized expert in networking who can code in over a dozen languages both interpreted and compiled. I hold two degrees which are primarily Cisco, Linux, and physics. I've worked in technology and business for over a decade including management roles, learning my first software development language twenty-five years ago. I spend my spare time in the gym or near a waterfall.

I first learned to code in 1998 in a engineering class using assembly on robotics. I then moved on to classes in business applications and web development where I learned what is not xhtml, javascript, photoshop, and flash animations. I freelanced and wrote macros in VBA and websites. In college I wrote both JAVA nad python applications to run robotics hardware as well as bash, c, and javascripts which you can check out some of in my examples repository.
