# 📈 About me

My name is William Gailey I come from a military and technology inclined family on a small living farm in Oregon. In High School I ran for class treasurer, I was in AFJROTC (Drill team and Color Guard), and on the ski team winning multiple trophies and awards. Throughout K-12 I foremost studied technology and physics while running and doing pushups.

I'm a nationally recognized expert in networking who can code in over a dozen languages both interpreted and compiled. I hold two degrees which are primarily in the datacenter and physics. I've worked in technology and business for over a decade including management roles and project management.
  
I first learned to code in 1998 in a engineering class using assembly on robotics. I then moved onto classes in business applications and web development where I learned what is now xhtml, css, javascript (via https://javascriptsource.com/ ), photoshop, and flash animations. I freelanced and wrote macros in VBA and built websites. In college I wrote both Java and Python applications to run robotics hardware as well as Bash, C, and Javascripts which you can check out some of in my examples repository.
